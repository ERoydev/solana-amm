# tokens_mint Module

This module was created for my Anchor project to initialize and mint SPL tokens for my AMM application.  
It allows you to easily set up test tokens on devnet, so you can interact with and test your AMM logic using real token accounts and mints.

Use this module to:
- Create new token mints for your pools
- Mint tokens to user accounts for testing
- Ensure your AMM can be tested and demonstrated on devnet

This setup is intended for development and testing
